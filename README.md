# C-Chess-Game
This is an interactive chess game written in C.

I built this game within an university course in a team with a partner.

The game includes GUI that was developed using SDL, and a computer AI, based on the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

There is also a ZIP file with an EXE version of the game.
